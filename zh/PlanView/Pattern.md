# Pattern

Pattern tool allows you to fly a complex pattern. It offers multiple options:

* A [Survey](../PlanView/Survey.md) allows you to create a grid flight pattern over a polygonal area. You can specify the polygon as well as the specifications for the grid and camera settings appropriate for creating geotagged images.

* A [Structure Scan](../PlanView/StructureScan.md) allows you to create a grid flight pattern that captures images over vertical surfaces (polygonal or circular). These are typically used for the visual inspection or creation of 3d models of structures.
